" 
 [1] The wrath sing,  goddess, of Peleus' son, Achilles, that destructive wrath which brought countless woes upon the Achaeans, and sent forth to Hades many valiant souls of heroes, and made them themselves spoil for dogs and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment, [5] from the time when first they parted in strife Atreus' son, king of men, and brilliant Achilles.","μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί̓ Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγἐ ἔθηκε, πολλὰς δ̓ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι, Διὸς δ̓ ἐτελείετο βουλή, ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε Ἀτρεΐδης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς."
"
Who then of the gods was it that brought these two together to contend?","τίς τ̓ ἄρ σφωε θεῶν ἔριδι ξυνέηκε μάχεσθαι;"
"  The son of Leto and Zeus; for he in anger against the king roused throughout the host an evil pestilence, and the people began to perish, [10] because upon the priest Chryses the son of Atreus had wrought dishonour.","Λητοῦς καὶ Διὸς υἱός·||ὃ γὰρ βασιλῆϊ χολωθεὶς νοῦσον ἀνὰ στρατὸν ὄρσε κακήν, ὀλέκοντο δὲ λαοί, οὕνεκα τὸν Χρύσην ἠτίμασεν ἀρητῆρα Ἀτρεΐδης·"
" For he had come to the swift ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, bearing ransom past counting; and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar, on a staff of gold; and he implored all the Achaeans, [15] but most of all the two sons of Atreus, the marshallers of the people:","ὃ γὰρ ἦλθε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν λυσόμενός τε θύγατρα φέρων τ̓ ἀπερείσἰ ἄποινα, στέμματ̓ ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος χρυσέῳ ἀνὰ σκήπτρῳ, καὶ λίσσετο πάντας Ἀχαιούς, Ἀτρεΐδα δὲ μάλιστα δύω, κοσμήτορε λαῶν·"
" ""Sons of Atreus, and other well-greaved Achaeans, to you may the gods who have homes upon Olympus grant that you sack the city of Priam, and return safe to your homes; but my dear child release to me, and accept the ransom [20] out of reverence for the son of Zeus, Apollo who strikes from afar.""","Ἀτρεΐδαι τε καὶ ἄλλοι ἐϋκνήμιδες Ἀχαιοί, ὑμῖν μὲν θεοὶ δοῖεν Ὀλύμπια δώματ̓ ἔχοντες ἐκπέρσαι Πριάμοιο πόλιν, εὖ δ̓ οἴκαδ̓ ἱκέσθαι·||παῖδα δ̓ ἐμοὶ λύσαιτε φίλην, τὰ δ̓ ἄποινα δέχεσθαι, ἁζόμενοι Διὸς υἱὸν ἑκηβόλον Ἀπόλλωνα."
"
Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom, yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command:","ἔνθ̓ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν Ἀχαιοὶ αἰδεῖσθαί θ̓ ἱερῆα καὶ ἀγλαὰ δέχθαι ἄποινα·||ἀλλ̓ οὐκ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ, ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει, κρατερὸν δ̓ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε·"
" [25] ""Let me not find you, old man, by the hollow ships, either tarrying now or coming back later, lest your staff and the wreath of the god not protect you.","μή σε γέρον κοίλῃσιν ἐγὼ παρὰ νηυσὶ κιχείω ἢ νῦν δηθύνοντ̓ ἢ ὕστερον αὖτις ἰόντα, μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμῃ σκῆπτρον καὶ στέμμα θεοῖο·"
" Her I will not set free.","τὴν δ̓ ἐγὼ οὐ λύσω·"
" Sooner shall old age come upon her in our house, in Argos, far from her native land, [30] as she walks to and fro before the loom and serves my bed.","πρίν μιν καὶ γῆρας ἔπεισιν ἡμετέρῳ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ ἐν Ἄργεϊ τηλόθι πάτρης ἱστὸν ἐποιχομένην καὶ ἐμὸν λέχος ἀντιόωσαν·"
"  But go, do not anger me, that you may return the safer.""","ἀλλ̓ ἴθι μή μ̓ ἐρέθιζε σαώτερος ὥς κε νέηαι."
" 
So he spoke, and the old man was seized with fear and obeyed his word.","ὣς ἔφατ̓, ἔδεισεν δ̓ ὃ γέρων καὶ ἐπείθετο μύθῳ·"
"  He went forth in silence along the shore of the loud-resounding sea, and earnestly then, when he had gone apart, the old man prayed [35] to the lord Apollo, whom fair-haired Leto bore:","βῆ δ̓ ἀκέων παρὰ θῖνα πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης·||πολλὰ δ̓ ἔπειτ̓ ἀπάνευθε κιὼν ἠρᾶθ̓ ὃ γεραιὸς Ἀπόλλωνι ἄνακτι, τὸν ἠΰκομος τέκε Λητώ·"
" ""Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stand over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rule mightily over Tenedos, Sminthian god, if ever I roofed over a temple to your pleasing, or if ever I burned to you fat thigh-pieces of bulls and goats, [40] fulfill this prayer for me:","κλῦθί μευ ἀργυρότοξ̓, ὃς Χρύσην ἀμφιβέβηκας Κίλλάν τε ζαθέην Τενέδοιό τε ἶφι ἀνάσσεις, Σμινθεῦ εἴ ποτέ τοι χαρίεντ̓ ἐπὶ νηὸν ἔρεψα, ἢ εἰ δή ποτέ τοι κατὰ πίονα μηρί̓ ἔκηα ταύρων ἠδ̓ αἰγῶν, τὸ δέ μοι κρήηνον ἐέλδωρ·"
" let the Danaans pay for my tears by your arrows""
So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him.","τίσειαν Δαναοὶ ἐμὰ δάκρυα σοῖσι βέλεσσιν."
"  Down from the peaks of Olympus he strode, angered at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver.","ὣς ἔφατ̓ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δ̓ ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων, βῆ δὲ κατ̓ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων χωόμενος κῆρ, τόξ̓ ὤμοισιν ἔχων ἀμφηρεφέα τε φαρέτρην·"
" [45] The arrows rattled on the shoulders of the angry god as he moved, and his coming was like the night.","ἔκλαγξαν δ̓ ἄῤ ὀϊστοὶ ἐπ̓ ὤμων χωομένοιο, αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος·||ὃ δ̓ ἤϊε νυκτὶ ἐοικώς."
"  Then he sat down apart from the ships and let fly an arrow:","ἕζετ̓ ἔπειτ̓ ἀπάνευθε νεῶν, μετὰ δ̓ ἰὸν ἕηκε·"
" terrible was the twang of the silver bow.","δεινὴ δὲ κλαγγὴ γένετ̓ ἀργυρέοιο βιοῖο·"
"  The mules he assailed first and the swift dogs, [50] but then on the men themselves he let fly his stinging shafts, and struck; and constantly the pyres of the dead burned thick.","οὐρῆας μὲν πρῶτον ἐπῴχετο καὶ κύνας ἀργούς, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ̓ αὐτοῖσι βέλος ἐχεπευκὲς ἐφιεὶς βάλλ̓·||αἰεὶ δὲ πυραὶ νεκύων καίοντο θαμειαί."
"
For nine days the missiles of the god ranged among the host, but on the tenth Achilles called the people to assembly, for the goddess, white-armed Hera, had put it in his heart, [55] since she pitied the Danaans, when she saw them dying.","ἐννῆμαρ μὲν ἀνὰ στρατὸν ᾤχετο κῆλα θεοῖο, τῇ δεκάτῃ δ̓ ἀγορὴν δὲ καλέσσατο λαὸν Ἀχιλλεύς·||τῷ γὰρ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη·||κήδετο γὰρ Δαναῶν, ὅτι ῥα θνήσκοντας ὁρᾶτο."
"  When they were assembled and gathered together, among them arose and spoke swift-footed Achilles:","οἳ δ̓ ἐπεὶ οὖν ἤγερθεν ὁμηγερέες τε γένοντο, τοῖσι δ̓ ἀνιστάμενος μετέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·"
"
""Son of Atreus, now I think we shall return home, beaten back again, should we even escape death, [60] if war and pestilence alike are to ravage the Achaeans.","Ἀτρεΐδη νῦν ἄμμε παλιμπλαγχθέντας ὀΐω ἂψ ἀπονοστήσειν, εἴ κεν θάνατόν γε φύγοιμεν, εἰ δὴ ὁμοῦ πόλεμός τε δαμᾷ καὶ λοιμὸς Ἀχαιούς·"
"  But come, let us ask some seer or priest, or some reader of dreams—for a dream too is from Zeus—who might say why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, whether he finds fault with a vow or a hecatomb; [65] in hope that he may accept the savour of lambs and unblemished goats, and be willing to ward off the pestilence from us.""","ἀλλ̓ ἄγε δή τινα μάντιν ἐρείομεν ἢ ἱερῆα ἢ καὶ ὀνειροπόλον, καὶ γάρ τ̓ ὄναρ ἐκ Διός ἐστιν, ὅς κ̓ εἴποι ὅ τι τόσσον ἐχώσατο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων, εἴτ̓ ἄῤ ὅ γ̓ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται ἠδ̓ ἑκατόμβης, αἴ κέν πως ἀρνῶν κνίσης αἰγῶν τε τελείων βούλεται ἀντιάσας ἡμῖν ἀπὸ λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι."
" 
When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose Calchas son of Thestor, far the best of bird-diviners, who knew the things that were, and that were to be, and that had been before, [70] and who had guided the ships of the Achaeans to Ilios by his own prophetic powers which Phoebus Apollo had bestowed upon him.","ἤτοι ὅ γ̓ ὣς εἰπὼν κατ̓ ἄῤ ἕζετο·||τοῖσι δ̓ ἀνέστη Κάλχας Θεστορίδης οἰωνοπόλων ὄχ̓ ἄριστος, ὃς ᾔδη τά τ̓ ἐόντα τά τ̓ ἐσσόμενα πρό τ̓ ἐόντα, καὶ νήεσσ̓ ἡγήσατ̓ Ἀχαιῶν Ἴλιον εἴσω ἣν διὰ μαντοσύνην, τήν οἱ πόρε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων·||ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν·"
"  He with good intent addressed the gathering, and spoke among them:","ὦ Ἀχιλεῦ κέλεαί με Διῒ φίλε μυθήσασθαι μῆνιν Ἀπόλλωνος ἑκατηβελέταο ἄνακτος·"
" ""Achilles, dear to Zeus, you bid me declare the wrath of Apollo, the lord who strikes from afar.",
" [75] Therefore I will speak; but take thought and swear that you will readily defend me with word and with might of hand; for I think I shall anger a man who rules mightily over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey.","τοὶ γὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω·||σὺ δὲ σύνθεο καί μοι ὄμοσσον ἦ μέν μοι πρόφρων ἔπεσιν καὶ χερσὶν ἀρήξειν·||ἦ γὰρ ὀΐομαι ἄνδρα χολωσέμεν, ὃς μέγα πάντων Ἀργείων κρατέει καί οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί·"
"  For mightier is a king, when he is angry at a lesser man.","κρείσσων γὰρ βασιλεὺς ὅτε χώσεται ἀνδρὶ χέρηϊ·"
" [80] Even if he swallows down his wrath for that day, yet afterwards he cherishes resentment in his heart till he brings it to fulfillment.","εἴ περ γάρ τε χόλον γε καὶ αὐτῆμαρ καταπέψῃ, ἀλλά τε καὶ μετόπισθεν ἔχει κότον, ὄφρα τελέσσῃ, ἐν στήθεσσιν ἑοῖσι·"
"  Say then, if you will keep me safe.""","σὺ δὲ φράσαι εἴ με σαώσεις."
"
In answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilles:","τὸν δ̓ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·"
" ""Take heart, and speak out whatever oracle you know; [85] for by Apollo, dear to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas, pray when you reveal oracles to the Danaans, no one, while I live and have sight on the earth, shall lay heavy hands on you beside the hollow ships, no one of the whole host of the Danaans, [90] not even if you name Agamemnon, who now claims to be far the best of the Achaeans.""","θαρσήσας μάλα εἰπὲ θεοπρόπιον ὅ τι οἶσθα·||οὐ μὰ γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνα Διῒ φίλον, ᾧ τε σὺ Κάλχαν εὐχόμενος Δαναοῖσι θεοπροπίας ἀναφαίνεις, οὔ τις ἐμεῦ ζῶντος καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο σοὶ κοίλῃς παρὰ νηυσί βαρείας χεῖρας ἐποίσει συμπάντων Δαναῶν, οὐ δ̓ ἢν Ἀγαμέμνονα εἴπῃς, ὃς νῦν πολλὸν ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν εὔχεται εἶναι."
" 
Then the blameless seer took heart, and spoke:","καὶ τότε δὴ θάρσησε καὶ ηὔδα μάντις ἀμύμων·"
"
""It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault, nor because of a hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured, and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom.","οὔ τ̓ ἄρ ὅ γ̓ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται οὐ δ̓ ἑκατόμβης, ἀλλ̓ ἕνεκ̓ ἀρητῆρος ὃν ἠτίμησ̓ Ἀγαμέμνων, οὐ δ̓ ἀπέλυσε θύγατρα καὶ οὐκ ἀπεδέξατ̓ ἄποινα, τοὔνεκ̓ ἄῤ ἄλγἐ ἔδωκεν ἑκηβόλος ἠδ̓ ἔτι δώσει·"
" [95] For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them.","οὐ δ̓ ὅ γε πρὶν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει πρίν γ̓ ἀπὸ πατρὶ φίλῳ δόμεναι ἑλικώπιδα κούρην ἀπριάτην ἀνάποινον, ἄγειν θ̓ ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ἐς Χρύσην·"
" He will not drive off from the Danaans the loathsome pestilence, until we give back to her dear father the bright-eyed maiden, unbought, unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb to Chryse.","τότε κέν μιν ἱλασσάμενοι πεπίθοιμεν."
" Then we might appease and persuade him.""",
" [100] 
When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose the warrior, son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, deeply troubled.","ἤτοι ὅ γ̓ ὣς εἰπὼν κατ̓ ἄῤ ἕζετο·||τοῖσι δ̓ ἀνέστη ἥρως Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων ἀχνύμενος·"
" With rage his black heart was wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire.","μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι πίμπλαντ̓, ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐΐκτην·"
"  To Calchas first of all he spoke, and his look threatened evil:","Κάλχαντα πρώτιστα κάκ̓ ὀσσόμενος προσέειπε·"
" [105] ""Prophet of evil, never yet have you spoken to me a pleasant thing; ever is evil dear to your heart to prophesy, but a word of good you have never yet spoken, nor brought to pass.","μάντι κακῶν οὐ πώ ποτέ μοι τὸ κρήγυον εἶπας·||αἰεί τοι τὰ κάκ̓ ἐστὶ φίλα φρεσὶ μαντεύεσθαι, ἐσθλὸν δ̓ οὔτέ τί πω εἶπας ἔπος οὔ τ̓ ἐτέλεσσας·"
"  And now among the Danaans you claim in prophecy that for this reason the god who strikes from afar brings woes upon them, [110] that I would not accept the glorious ransom for the girl, the daughter of Chryses, since I much prefer to keep her in my home.","καὶ νῦν ἐν Δαναοῖσι θεοπροπέων ἀγορεύεις ὡς δὴ τοῦδ̓ ἕνεκά σφιν ἑκηβόλος ἄλγεα τεύχει, οὕνεκ̓ ἐγὼ κούρης Χρυσηΐδος ἀγλά̓ ἄποινα οὐκ ἔθελον δέξασθαι, ἐπεὶ πολὺ βούλομαι αὐτὴν οἴκοι ἔχειν·"
"  For certainly I prefer her to Clytemnestra, my wedded wife, since she is not inferior to her, either in form or in stature, or in mind, or in  any handiwork.","καὶ γάρ ῥα Κλυταιμνήστρης προβέβουλα κουριδίης ἀλόχου, ἐπεὶ οὔ ἑθέν ἐστι χερείων, οὐ δέμας οὐ δὲ φυήν, οὔ τ̓ ἂρ φρένας οὔτέ τι ἔργα."
" [115] Yet even so will I give her back, if that is better; I would rather the people be safe than perish.","ἀλλὰ καὶ ὧς ἐθέλω δόμεναι πάλιν εἰ τό γ̓ ἄμεινον·||βούλομ̓ ἐγὼ λαὸν σῶν ἔμμεναι ἢ ἀπολέσθαι·"
"  But provide me with a prize of honour forthwith, lest I alone of the Argives be without one, since that would not be proper.","αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ γέρας αὐτίχ̓ ἑτοιμάσατ̓ ὄφρα μὴ οἶος Ἀργείων ἀγέραστος ἔω, ἐπεὶ οὐ δὲ ἔοικε·"
" For you all see this, that my prize goes elsewhere.""","λεύσσετε γὰρ τό γε πάντες ὅ μοι γέρας ἔρχεται ἄλλῃ."
" [120] 
In answer to him spoke swift-footed brilliant Achilles:","τὸν δ̓ ἠμείβετ̓ ἔπειτα ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς·"
"
""Most glorious son of Atreus, most covetous of all, how shall the great-hearted Achaeans give you a prize?","Ἀτρεΐδη κύδιστε φιλοκτεανώτατε πάντων, πῶς γάρ τοι δώσουσι γέρας μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοί;"
"  We know nothing of a hoard of wealth in common store, but whatever we took by pillage from the cities has been apportioned, [125] and it is not seemly to gather these things back from the army.","οὐ δέ τί που ἴδμεν ξυνήϊα κείμενα πολλά·||ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν πολίων ἐξεπράθομεν, τὰ δέδασται, λαοὺς δ̓ οὐκ ἐπέοικε παλίλλογα ταῦτ̓ ἐπαγείρειν."
" But give back the girl to the god, and we Achaeans will recompense you three and fourfold, if ever Zeus grants us to sack the well-walled city of Troy.""","ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν τήνδε θεῷ πρόες·||αὐτὰρ Ἀχαιοὶ τριπλῇ τετραπλῇ τ̓ ἀποτείσομεν, αἴ κέ ποθι Ζεὺς δῷσι πόλιν Τροίην εὐτείχεον ἐξαλαπάξαι."
" 
In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon:","τὸν δ̓ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων·"
" [130] ""Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit; for you will not get by me nor persuade me.","μὴ δ̓ οὕτως ἀγαθός περ ἐὼν θεοείκελ̓ Ἀχιλλεῦ κλέπτε νόῳ, ἐπεὶ οὐ παρελεύσεαι οὐ δέ με πείσεις."
" Are you willing, so that your yourself may keep your prize, for me to sit here idly in want, while you order me to give her back?","ἦ ἐθέλεις ὄφῤ αὐτὸς ἔχῃς γέρας, αὐτὰρ ἔμ̓ αὔτως ἧσθαι δευόμενον, κέλεαι δέ με τήνδ̓ ἀποδοῦναι;"
"  No, if the great-hearted Achaeans give me a prize, [135] suiting it to my mind, so that it will be worth just as much—but if they do not, I myself will come and take your prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus I will seize and bear away.","ἀλλ̓ εἰ μὲν δώσουσι γέρας μεγάθυμοι Ἀχαιοὶ ἄρσαντες κατὰ θυμὸν ὅπως ἀντάξιον ἔσται·||εἰ δέ κε μὴ δώωσιν ἐγὼ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἕλωμαι ἢ τεὸν ἢ Αἴαντος ἰὼν γέρας, ἢ Ὀδυσῆος ἄξω ἑλών·"
"  Angry will he be, to whomever I come.","ὃ δέ κεν κεχολώσεται ὅν κεν ἵκωμαι."
" But these things we will consider hereafter.","ἀλλ̓ ἤτοι μὲν ταῦτα μεταφρασόμεσθα καὶ αὖτις, νῦν δ̓ ἄγε νῆα μέλαιναν ἐρύσσομεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν, ἐν δ̓ ἐρέτας ἐπιτηδὲς ἀγείρομεν, ἐς δ̓ ἑκατόμβην θείομεν, ἂν δ̓ αὐτὴν Χρυσηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον βήσομεν·"
" [140] Let us now drag a black ship to the shining sea, and quickly gather suitable rowers into it, and place on board a hecatomb, and embark on it the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses herself.","εἷς δέ τις ἀρχὸς ἀνὴρ βουληφόρος ἔστω, ἢ Αἴας ἢ Ἰδομενεὺς ἢ δῖος Ὀδυσσεὺς ἠὲ σὺ Πηλεΐδη πάντων ἐκπαγλότατ̓ ἀνδρῶν, ὄφῤ ἥμιν ἑκάεργον ἱλάσσεαι ἱερὰ ῥέξας."
"  Let one prudent man be its commander, either Aias, or Idomeneus, or brilliant Odysseus, [145] or you, son of Peleus, of all men most extreme, so that on our behalf you may propitiate the god who strikes from afar by offering sacrifice.""","τὸν δ̓ ἄῤ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·||ὤ μοι ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένε κερδαλεόφρον πῶς τίς τοι πρόφρων ἔπεσιν πείθηται Ἀχαιῶν ἢ ὁδὸν ἐλθέμεναι ἢ ἀνδράσιν ἶφι μάχεσθαι;"
"
Glaring from beneath his brows spoke to him swift-footed Achilles:",
" ""Ah me, clothed in shamelessness, thinking of profit, how shall any man of the Achaeans obey your words with a ready heart [150] either to go on a journey or to fight against men with force?","οὐ γὰρ ἐγὼ Τρώων ἕνεκ̓ ἤλυθον αἰχμητάων δεῦρο μαχησόμενος, ἐπεὶ οὔ τί μοι αἴτιοί εἰσιν·"
"  It was not on account of the Trojan spearmen that I came here to fight, since they have done no wrong to me.","οὐ γὰρ πώποτ̓ ἐμὰς βοῦς ἤλασαν οὐ δὲ μὲν ἵππους, οὐ δέ ποτ̓ ἐν Φθίῃ ἐριβώλακι βωτιανείρῃ καρπὸν ἐδηλήσαντ̓, ἐπεὶ ἦ μάλα πολλὰ μεταξὺ οὔρεά τε σκιόεντα θάλασσά τε ἠχήεσσα·"
"  Never have they driven off my cattle or my horses, nor ever in deep-soiled Phthia, nurse of men, [155] did they lay waste the harvest, for many things lie between us—shadowy mountains and sounding sea.","ἀλλὰ σοὶ ὦ μέγ̓ ἀναιδὲς ἅμ̓ ἑσπόμεθ̓ ὄφρα σὺ χαίρῃς, τιμὴν ἀρνύμενοι Μενελάῳ σοί τε κυνῶπα πρὸς Τρώων·||τῶν οὔ τι μετατρέπῃ οὐ δ̓ ἀλεγίζεις·"
"  But you, shameless one, we followed, so that you might rejoice, seeking to win recompense for Menelaus and for yourself, dog-face, from the Trojans.",
"  This you disregard, and take no heed of.",
" [160] And now you threaten that you will yourself take my prize away from me, for which I toiled so much, which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.","καὶ δή μοι γέρας αὐτὸς ἀφαιρήσεσθαι ἀπειλεῖς, ᾧ ἔπι πολλὰ μόγησα, δόσαν δέ μοι υἷες Ἀχαιῶν."
" Never have I prize like yours, whenever the Achaeans sack a well-inhabited citadel of the Trojans.","οὐ μὲν σοί ποτε ἶσον ἔχω γέρας ὁππότ̓ Ἀχαιοὶ Τρώων ἐκπέρσωσ̓ εὖ ναιόμενον πτολίεθρον·"
" The brunt of furious battle [165] do my hands undertake, but if ever an apportionment comes, your prize is far greater, while small but dear is the reward I take to my ships, when I have worn myself out in the fighting.","ἀλλὰ τὸ μὲν πλεῖον πολυάϊκος πολέμοιο χεῖρες ἐμαὶ διέπουσ̓·||ἀτὰρ ἤν ποτε δασμὸς ἵκηται, σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον, ἐγὼ δ̓ ὀλίγον τε φίλον τε ἔρχομ̓ ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆας, ἐπεί κε κάμω πολεμίζων."
" Now I will go back to Phthia, since it is far better to return home with my beaked ships, nor do I intend [170] while I am here dishonoured to pile up riches and wealth for you.""","νῦν δ̓ εἶμι Φθίην δ̓, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτερόν ἐστιν οἴκαδ̓ ἴμεν σὺν νηυσὶ κορωνίσιν, οὐ δέ σ̓ ὀΐω ἐνθάδ̓ ἄτιμος ἐὼν ἄφενος καὶ πλοῦτον ἀφύξειν."
" 
Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him:","τὸν δ̓ ἠμείβετ̓ ἔπειτα ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων·"
" ""Flee then, if your heart urges you; I do not beg you to remain for my sake.","φεῦγε μάλ̓ εἴ τοι θυμὸς ἐπέσσυται, οὐ δέ σ̓ ἔγωγε λίσσομαι εἵνεκ̓ ἐμεῖο μένειν·"
"  With me are others who will honour me, and above all Zeus, the lord of counsel.","πάῤ ἔμοιγε καὶ ἄλλοι οἵ κέ με τιμήσουσι, μάλιστα δὲ μητίετα Ζεύς."
" [175] Most hateful to me are you of all the kings that Zeus nurtures, for  always strife is dear to you, and wars and battles.","ἔχθιστος δέ μοί ἐσσι διοτρεφέων βασιλήων·||αἰεὶ γάρ τοι ἔρις τε φίλη πόλεμοί τε μάχαι τε·"
"  If you are very strong, it was a god, I think, who gave you this gift.","εἰ μάλα καρτερός ἐσσι, θεός που σοὶ τό γ̓ ἔδωκεν·"
"  Go home with your ships and your companions and lord it over the Myrmidons; for you I care not, [180] nor take heed of your wrath.","οἴκαδ̓ ἰὼν σὺν νηυσί τε σῇς καὶ σοῖς ἑτάροισι Μυρμιδόνεσσιν ἄνασσε, σέθεν δ̓ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀλεγίζω, οὐ δ̓ ὄθομαι κοτέοντος·"
" But I will threaten you thus:","ἀπειλήσω δέ τοι ὧδε·"
" as Phoebus Apollo takes from me the daughter of Chryses, her with my ship and my companions I will send back, but I will myself come to your tent and take the fair-cheeked Briseis, your prize, so that you will understand [185] how much mightier I am than you, and another may shrink from declaring himself my equal and likening himself to me to my face.""","ὡς ἔμ̓ ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηΐδα Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων, τὴν μὲν ἐγὼ σὺν νηΐ τ̓ ἐμῇ καὶ ἐμοῖς ἑτάροισι πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ̓ ἄγω Βρισηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον αὐτὸς ἰὼν κλισίην δὲ τὸ σὸν γέρας ὄφῤ ἐῢ εἰδῇς ὅσσον φέρτερός εἰμι σέθεν, στυγέῃ δὲ καὶ ἄλλος ἶσον ἐμοὶ φάσθαι καὶ ὁμοιωθήμεναι ἄντην."
"
So he spoke.","ὣς φάτο·"
" Grief came upon the son of Peleus, and within his shaggy breast his heart was divided, whether he should draw his sharp sword from beside his thigh, [190] and break up the assembly, and slay the son of Atreus, or stay his anger and curb his spirit.","Πηλεΐωνι δ̓ ἄχος γένετ̓, ἐν δέ οἱ ἦτορ στήθεσσιν λασίοισι διάνδιχα μερμήριξεν, ἢ ὅ γε φάσγανον ὀξὺ ἐρυσσάμενος παρὰ μηροῦ τοὺς μὲν ἀναστήσειεν, ὃ δ̓ Ἀτρεΐδην ἐναρίζοι, ἦε χόλον παύσειεν ἐρητύσειέ τε θυμόν."
"  While he pondered this in mind and heart, and was drawing from its sheath his great sword, Athene came from heaven.","ἧος ὃ ταῦθ̓ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, ἕλκετο δ̓ ἐκ κολεοῖο μέγα ξίφος, ἦλθε δ̓ Ἀθήνη οὐρανόθεν·"
" The white-armed goddess Hera had sent her forth, [195] for in her heart she loved and cared for both men alike.","πρὸ γὰρ ἧκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη ἄμφω ὁμῶς θυμῷ φιλέουσά τε κηδομένη τε·"
"
She stood behind him, and seized the son of Peleus by his fair hair, appearing to him alone.","στῆ δ̓ ὄπιθεν, ξανθῆς δὲ κόμης ἕλε Πηλεΐωνα οἴῳ φαινομένη·"
" No one of the others saw her.","τῶν δ̓ ἄλλων οὔ τις ὁρᾶτο·"
" Achilles was seized with wonder, and turned around, and immediately recognized Pallas Athene.","θάμβησεν δ̓ Ἀχιλεύς, μετὰ δ̓ ἐτράπετ̓, αὐτίκα δ̓ ἔγνω Παλλάδ̓ Ἀθηναίην·"
" Terribly her eyes shone.","δεινὼ δέ οἱ ὄσσε φάανθεν·"
" [200] Then he addressed her with winged words, and said:","καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·"
" ""Why now, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, have you come?","τίπτ̓ αὖτ̓ αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος εἰλήλουθας;"
" Is it so that you might see the arrogance of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?","ἦ ἵνα ὕβριν ἴδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονος Ἀτρεΐδαο;"
" One thing I will tell you, and I think this will be brought to pass:","ἀλλ̓ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τελέεσθαι ὀΐω·"
" through his own excessive pride shall he presently lose his life.""","ᾗς ὑπεροπλίῃσι τάχ̓ ἄν ποτε θυμὸν ὀλέσσῃ."
" 
Him then the goddess, bright-eyed Athene, answered:","τὸν δ̓ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη·"
"
""I have come from heaven to stay your anger, if you will obey, The goddess white-armed Hera sent me forth, for in her heart she loves and cares for both of you.","ἦλθον ἐγὼ παύσουσα τὸ σὸν μένος, αἴ κε πίθηαι, οὐρανόθεν·||πρὸ δέ μ̓ ἧκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη ἄμφω ὁμῶς θυμῷ φιλέουσά τε κηδομένη τε·"
" But come, cease from strife, and do not grasp the sword with your hand.","ἀλλ̓ ἄγε λῆγ̓ ἔριδος, μη δὲ ξίφος ἕλκεο χειρί·"
" [210] With words indeed taunt him, telling him how it shall be.","ἀλλ̓ ἤτοι ἔπεσιν μὲν ὀνείδισον ὡς ἔσεταί περ·"
" For thus will I speak, and this thing shall truly be brought to pass.","ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται·"
" Hereafter three times as many glorious gifts shall be yours on account of  this arrogance.","καί ποτέ τοι τρὶς τόσσα παρέσσεται ἀγλαὰ δῶρα ὕβριος εἵνεκα τῆσδε·"
" But refrain, and obey us.""","σὺ δ̓ ἴσχεο, πείθεο δ̓ ἡμῖν."
"
In answer to her spoke swift-footed Achilles:","τὴν δ̓ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·"
" [215] ""It is necessary, goddess, to observe the words of you two, however angered a man be in his heart, for is it better so.","χρὴ μὲν σφωΐτερόν γε θεὰ ἔπος εἰρύσσασθαι καὶ μάλα περ θυμῷ κεχολωμένον·||ὧς γὰρ ἄμεινον·"
"  Whoever obeys the gods, to him do they gladly give ear.""","ὅς κε θεοῖς ἐπιπείθηται μάλα τ̓ ἔκλυον αὐτοῦ."
"
He spoke, and stayed his heavy hand on the silver hilt, and back into its sheath thrust the great sword, and did not disobey [220] the word of Athene.","ἦ καὶ ἐπ̓ ἀργυρέῃ κώπῃ σχέθε χεῖρα βαρεῖαν, ἂψ δ̓ ἐς κουλεὸν ὦσε μέγα ξίφος, οὐ δ̓ ἀπίθησε μύθῳ Ἀθηναίης·"
" She returned to Olympus to the palace of aegis-bearing Zeus, to join the company of the other gods.","ἣ δ̓ Οὔλυμπον δὲ βεβήκει δώματ̓ ἐς αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς μετὰ δαίμονας ἄλλους."
"
But the son of Peleus again addressed with violent words the son of Atreus, and in no way ceased from his wrath:","Πηλεΐδης δ̓ ἐξαῦτις ἀταρτηροῖς ἐπέεσσιν Ἀτρεΐδην προσέειπε, καὶ οὔ πω λῆγε χόλοιο·"
" ""Heavy with wine, with the face of a dog but the heart of a deer, [225] never have you had courage to arm for battle along with your people, or go forth to an ambush with the chiefs of the Achaeans.","οἰνοβαρές, κυνὸς ὄμματ̓ ἔχων, κραδίην δ̓ ἐλάφοιο, οὔτέ ποτ̓ ἐς πόλεμον ἅμα λαῷ θωρηχθῆναι οὔ τε λόχον δ̓ ἰέναι σὺν ἀριστήεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν τέτληκας θυμῷ·"
"  That seems to you even as death.","τὸ δέ τοι κὴρ εἴδεται εἶναι."
" Indeed it is far better throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans to deprive of his prize whoever speaks contrary to you.","ἦ πολὺ λώϊόν ἐστι κατὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν δῶῤ ἀποαιρεῖσθαι ὅς τις σέθεν ἀντίον εἴπῃ·"
" [230] People-devouring king, since you rule over nobodies; else, son of Atreus, this would be your last piece of insolence.","δημοβόρος βασιλεὺς ἐπεὶ οὐτιδανοῖσιν ἀνάσσεις·||ἦ γὰρ ἂν Ἀτρεΐδη νῦν ὕστατα λωβήσαιο."
" But I will speak out to you, and will swear thereto a mighty oath:","ἀλλ̓ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω καὶ ἐπὶ μέγαν ὅρκον ὀμοῦμαι·"
" by this staff, that shall never more put forth leaves or shoots since first it left its stump among the mountains, [235] nor shall it again grow green, for the bronze has stripped it on all sides of leaves and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans carry it in their hands when they act as judges, those who guard the ordinances that come from Zeus; and this shall be for you a mighty oath.","ναὶ μὰ τόδε σκῆπτρον, τὸ μὲν οὔ ποτε φύλλα καὶ ὄζους φύσει, ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτα τομὴν ἐν ὄρεσσι λέλοιπεν, οὐ δ̓ ἀναθηλήσει·||περὶ γάρ ῥά ἑ χαλκὸς ἔλεψε φύλλά τε καὶ φλοιόν·||νῦν αὖτέ μιν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν ἐν παλάμῃς φορέουσι δικασπόλοι, οἵ τε θέμιστας πρὸς Διὸς εἰρύαται·||ὃ δέ τοι μέγας ἔσσεται ὅρκος·"
" Surely some day a longing for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans [240] one and all, and on that day you will not be able to help them at all, for all your grief, when many shall fall dying before man-slaying Hector.","ἦ ποτ̓ Ἀχιλλῆος ποθὴ ἵξεται υἷας Ἀχαιῶν σύμπαντας·||τότε δ̓ οὔ τι δυνήσεαι ἀχνύμενός περ χραισμεῖν, εὖτ̓ ἂν πολλοὶ ὑφ̓ Ἕκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο θνήσκοντες πίπτωσι·"
"  But you will gnaw the heart within you, in anger that you did no honour to the best of the Achaeans.""","σὺ δ̓ ἔνδοθι θυμὸν ἀμύξεις χωόμενος ὅ τ̓ ἄριστον Ἀχαιῶν οὐδὲν ἔτισας."
" 
So spoke the son of Peleus, and down to the earth he dashed [245] the staff studded with golden nails, and himself sat down, while over against him the son of Atreus continued to vent his wrath.","ὣς φάτο Πηλεΐδης, ποτὶ δὲ σκῆπτρον βάλε γαίῃ χρυσείοις ἥλοισι πεπαρμένον, ἕζετο δ̓ αὐτός·||Ἀτρεΐδης δ̓ ἑτέρωθεν ἐμήνιε·"
"  Then among them arose Nestor, sweet of speech, the clear-voiced orator of the Pylians, from whose tongue flowed speech sweeter than honey.","τοῖσι δὲ Νέστωρ ἡδυεπὴς ἀνόρουσε λιγὺς Πυλίων ἀγορητής, τοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ γλώσσης μέλιτος γλυκίων ῥέεν αὐδή·"
" Two generations of mortal men had passed away in his lifetime, [250] who had been born and reared with him before in sacred Pylos, and he was king among the third.","τῷ δ̓ ἤδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ μερόπων ἀνθρώπων ἐφθίαθ̓, οἵ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα τράφεν ἠδ̓ ἐγένοντο ἐν Πύλῳ ἠγαθέῃ, μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν·"
" He with good intent addressed the gathering and spoke among them:","ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν·"
" ""Comrades, great grief has come upon the land of Achaea.","ὦ πόποι ἦ μέγα πένθος Ἀχαιΐδα γαῖαν ἱκάνει·"
" Truly would Priam and the sons of Priam [255] rejoice, and the rest of the Trojans would be most glad at heart, were they to hear all this of you two quarrelling, you who are chief among the Danaans in counsel and chief in war.","ἦ κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες ἄλλοι τε Τρῶες μέγα κεν κεχαροίατο θυμῷ εἰ σφῶϊν τάδε πάντα πυθοίατο μαρναμένοιϊν, οἳ περὶ μὲν βουλὴν Δαναῶν, περὶ δ̓ ἐστὲ μάχεσθαι."
"  Listen to me, for you are both younger than I.","ἀλλὰ πίθεσθ̓·||ἄμφω δὲ νεωτέρω ἐστὸν ἐμεῖο·"
" In earlier times I moved among men more warlike than you, [260] and never did they despise me.","ἤδη γάρ ποτ̓ ἐγὼ καὶ ἀρείοσιν ἠέ περ ὑμῖν ἀνδράσιν ὡμίλησα, καὶ οὔ ποτέ μ̓ οἵ γ̓ ἀθέριζον."
" Such warriors have I never since seen, nor shall I see, as Peirithous was and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus, son of Aegeus, a man like the immortals.","οὐ γάρ πω τοίους ἴδον ἀνέρας οὐ δὲ ἴδωμαι, οἷον Πειρίθοόν τε Δρύαντά τε ποιμένα λαῶν Καινέα τ̓ Ἐξάδιόν τε καὶ ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον Θησέα τ̓ Αἰγεΐδην, ἐπιείκελον ἀθανάτοισιν·"
" [265] Mightiest were these of men reared upon the earth; mightiest were they, and with the mightiest they fought, the mountain-dwelling centaurs, and they destroyed them terribly.","κάρτιστοι δὴ κεῖνοι ἐπιχθονίων τράφεν ἀνδρῶν·||κάρτιστοι μὲν ἔσαν καὶ καρτίστοις ἐμάχοντο φηρσὶν ὀρεσκῴοισι καὶ ἐκπάγλως ἀπόλεσσαν."
"  With these men I had fellowship, when I came from Pylos, from a distant land far away; for they themselves called me.","καὶ μὲν τοῖσιν ἐγὼ μεθομίλεον ἐκ Πύλου ἐλθὼν τηλόθεν ἐξ ἀπίης γαίης·||καλέσαντο γὰρ αὐτοί·"
" [270] And I fought on my own; with those men could no one fight of the mortals now upon the earth.","καὶ μαχόμην κατ̓ ἔμ̓ αὐτὸν ἐγώ·||κείνοισι δ̓ ἂν οὔ τις τῶν οἳ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπιχθόνιοι μαχέοιτο·"
"  Yes, and they listened to my counsel, and obeyed my words.","καὶ μέν μευ βουλέων ξύνιεν πείθοντό τε μύθῳ·"
"  So also should you obey, since to obey is better.","ἀλλὰ πίθεσθε καὶ ὔμμες, ἐπεὶ πείθεσθαι ἄμεινον·"
"  Neither do you, mighty though you are, take away the girl, [275] but let her be, as the sons of the Achaeans first gave her to him as a prize; nor do you, son of Peleus, be minded to strive with a king, might against might, for it is no common honour that is the portion of a sceptre-holding king, to whom Zeus gives glory.","μήτε σὺ τόνδ̓ ἀγαθός περ ἐὼν ἀποαίρεο κούρην, ἀλλ̓ ἔα ὥς οἱ πρῶτα δόσαν γέρας υἷες Ἀχαιῶν·||μήτε σὺ Πηλείδη ἔθελ̓ ἐριζέμεναι βασιλῆϊ ἀντιβίην, ἐπεὶ οὔ ποθ̓ ὁμοίης ἔμμορε τιμῆς σκηπτοῦχος βασιλεύς, ᾧ τε Ζεὺς κῦδος ἔδωκεν."
" If you are a stronger fighter, and a goddess mother bore you, [280] yet he is the mightier, since he is king over more.","εἰ δὲ σὺ καρτερός ἐσσι θεὰ δέ σε γείνατο μήτηρ, ἀλλ̓ ὅ γε φέρτερός ἐστιν ἐπεὶ πλεόνεσσιν ἀνάσσει."
"  Son of Atreus, check your rage.","Ἀτρεΐδη σὺ δὲ παῦε τεὸν μένος·"
" Indeed, I beg you to let go your anger against Achilles, who is for all the Achaeans a mighty bulwark in evil war.""","αὐτὰρ ἔγωγε λίσσομ̓ Ἀχιλλῆϊ μεθέμεν χόλον, ὃς μέγα πᾶσιν ἕρκος Ἀχαιοῖσιν πέλεται πολέμοιο κακοῖο."
" 
In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon:","τὸν δ̓ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων·"
" [285] ""All these things, old man, to be sure, you have spoken as is right.","ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα γέρον κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες·"
"  But this man wishes to be above all others; over all he wishes to rule and over all to be king, and to all to give orders; in this, I think, there is someone who will not obey.","ἀλλ̓ ὅδ̓ ἀνὴρ ἐθέλει περὶ πάντων ἔμμεναι ἄλλων, πάντων μὲν κρατέειν ἐθέλει, πάντεσσι δ̓ ἀνάσσειν, πᾶσι δὲ σημαίνειν, ἅ τιν̓ οὐ πείσεσθαι ὀΐω·"
" If the gods who exist for ever made him a spearman, [290] do they therefore license him to keep uttering insults?""","εἰ δέ μιν αἰχμητὴν ἔθεσαν θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες τοὔνεκά οἱ προθέουσιν ὀνείδεα μυθήσασθαι;"
"
Brilliant Achilles broke in upon him and replied:","τὸν δ̓ ἄῤ ὑποβλήδην ἠμείβετο δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς·"
" ""Surely I would be called cowardly and of no account, if I am to yield to you in every matter that you say.","ἦ γάρ κεν δειλός τε καὶ οὐτιδανὸς καλεοίμην εἰ δὴ σοὶ πᾶν ἔργον ὑπείξομαι ὅττί κεν εἴπῃς·"
"  On others lay these commands, but do not give orders to me, [295] for I do not think I shall obey you any longer.","ἄλλοισιν δὴ ταῦτ̓ ἐπιτέλλεο, μὴ γὰρ ἔμοιγε σήμαιν̓·||οὐ γὰρ ἔγωγ̓ ἔτι σοὶ πείσεσθαι ὀΐω."
"  And another thing I will tell you, and take it to heart:","ἄλλο δέ τοι ἐρέω, σὺ δ̓ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ βάλλεο σῇσι·"
" with my hands I will not fight for the girl's sake either with you nor with any other, since you are taking away what you have given.","χερσὶ μὲν οὔ τοι ἔγωγε μαχήσομαι εἵνεκα κούρης οὔ τε σοὶ οὔτέ τῳ ἄλλῳ, ἐπεί μ̓ ἀφέλεσθέ γε δόντες·"
"  But of all else that is mine by my swift black ship, [300] nothing will you take or carry away against my will.","τῶν δ̓ ἄλλων ἅ μοί ἐστι θοῇ παρὰ νηῒ μελαίνῃ τῶν οὐκ ἄν τι φέροις ἀνελὼν ἀέκοντος ἐμεῖο·"
" Come, just try, so that these too may know:","εἰ δ̓ ἄγε μὴν πείρησαι ἵνα γνώωσι καὶ οἵδε·"
" forthwith will your dark blood flow forth about my spear.""","αἶψά τοι αἷμα κελαινὸν ἐρωήσει περὶ δουρί."
"
So when the two had made an end of contending with violent words, they rose, and broke up the gathering beside the ships of the Achaeans.","ὣς τώ γ̓ ἀντιβίοισι μαχεσσαμένω ἐπέεσσιν ἀνστήτην, λῦσαν δ̓ ἀγορὴν παρὰ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν·"
" [305] The son of Peleus went his way to his huts and his balanced ships together with the son of Menoetius, and with his men; but the son of Atreus launched a swift ship on the sea, and chose for it twenty rowers, and drove on board a hecatomb for the god, and brought the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses and set her in the ship; [310] and Odysseus of many wiles went on board to take command.","Πηλεΐδης μὲν ἐπὶ κλισίας καὶ νῆας ἐΐσας ἤϊε σύν τε Μενοιτιάδῃ καὶ οἷς ἑτάροισιν·||Ἀτρεΐδης δ̓ ἄρα νῆα θοὴν ἅλα δὲ προέρυσσεν, ἐν δ̓ ἐρέτας ἔκρινεν ἐείκοσιν, ἐς δ̓ ἑκατόμβην βῆσε θεῷ, ἀνὰ δὲ Χρυσηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον εἷσεν ἄγων·||ἐν δ̓ ἀρχὸς ἔβη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς."
" 
So these embarked and sailed over the watery ways; but the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves.","οἳ μὲν ἔπειτ̓ ἀναβάντες ἐπέπλεον ὑγρὰ κέλευθα, λαοὺς δ̓ Ἀτρεΐδης ἀπολυμαίνεσθαι ἄνωγεν·"
"  And they purified themselves, and cast the defilement into the sea, and offered to Apollo perfect hecatombs [315] of bulls and goats by the shore of the barren sea; and the savour thereof went up to heaven, eddying amid the smoke.","οἳ δ̓ ἀπελυμαίνοντο καὶ εἰς ἅλα λύματα βάλλον, ἕρδον δ̓ Ἀπόλλωνι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας ταύρων ἠδ̓ αἰγῶν παρὰ θῖν̓ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο·||κνίση δ̓ οὐρανὸν ἷκεν ἑλισσομένη περὶ καπνῷ."
"
Thus were they busied throughout the camp; but Agamemnon did not cease from the strife with which he had first threatened Achilles, but called to Talthybius and Eurybates, [320] who were his heralds and ready squires:","ὣς οἳ μὲν τὰ πένοντο κατὰ στρατόν·||οὐ δ̓ Ἀγαμέμνων λῆγ̓ ἔριδος τὴν πρῶτον ἐπηπείλησ̓ Ἀχιλῆϊ, ἀλλ̓ ὅ γε Ταλθύβιόν τε καὶ Εὐρυβάτην προσέειπε, τώ οἱ ἔσαν κήρυκε καὶ ὀτρηρὼ θεράποντε·"
" ""Go to the hut of Achilles, Peleus' son, and take by the hand the fair-cheeked Briseis, and lead her hither; and if he give her not, I will myself go with a larger company and take her; that will be even the worse for him.""","ἔρχεσθον κλισίην Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος·||χειρὸς ἑλόντ̓ ἀγέμεν Βρισηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον·||εἰ δέ κε μὴ δώῃσιν ἐγὼ δέ κεν αὐτὸς ἕλωμαι ἐλθὼν σὺν πλεόνεσσι·||τό οἱ καὶ ῥίγιον ἔσται."
" [325] 
So saying he sent them forth, and laid upon them a stern command.","ὣς εἰπὼν προΐει, κρατερὸν δ̓ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε·"
"  Unwilling went the two along the shore of the barren sea, and came to the tents and the ships of the Myrmidons.","τὼ δ̓ ἀέκοντε βάτην παρὰ θῖν̓ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο, Μυρμιδόνων δ̓ ἐπί τε κλισίας καὶ νῆας ἱκέσθην, τὸν δ̓ εὗρον παρά τε κλισίῃ καὶ νηῒ μελαίνῃ ἥμενον·"
"  Him they found sitting beside his tent and his black ship; and Achilles was not glad at sight of them.","οὐ δ̓ ἄρα τώ γε ἰδὼν γήθησεν Ἀχιλλεύς."
" [330] The two, seized with dread and in awe of the king, stood, and spoke no word to him, nor made question; but he knew in his heart, and spoke:","τὼ μὲν ταρβήσαντε καὶ αἰδομένω βασιλῆα στήτην, οὐ δέ τί μιν προσεφώνεον οὐ δ̓ ἐρέοντο·"
" ""Hail, heralds, messengers of Zeus and men, draw near.","αὐτὰρ ὃ ἔγνω ᾗσιν ἐνὶ φρεσὶ φώνησέν τε·"
" It is not you who are guilty in my sight, but Agamemnon, [335] who sent you forth for the sake of the girl, Briseis.","χαίρετε κήρυκες Διὸς ἄγγελοι ἠδὲ καὶ ἀνδρῶν, ἆσσον ἴτ̓·"
"  But come, Patroclus, sprung from Zeus, bring forth the girl, and give her to them to lead away.","οὔ τί μοι ὔμμες ἐπαίτιοι ἀλλ̓ Ἀγαμέμνων, ὃ σφῶϊ προΐει Βρισηΐδος εἵνεκα κούρης."
"  However, let these two themselves be witnesses before the blessed gods and mortal men, and before him, that ruthless king, if hereafter [340] there shall be need of me to ward off shameful ruin from the host.","ἀλλ̓ ἄγε διογενὲς Πατρόκλεες ἔξαγε κούρην καί σφωϊν δὸς ἄγειν·||τὼ δ̓ αὐτὼ μάρτυροι ἔστων πρός τε θεῶν μακάρων πρός τε θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ πρὸς τοῦ βασιλῆος ἀπηνέος εἴ ποτε δ̓ αὖτε χρειὼ ἐμεῖο γένηται ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι τοῖς ἄλλοις·||ἦ γὰρ ὅ γ̓ ὀλοιῇσι φρεσὶ θύει, οὐ δέ τι οἶδε νοῆσαι ἅμα πρόσσω καὶ ὀπίσσω, ὅππως οἱ παρὰ νηυσὶ σόοι μαχέοιντο Ἀχαιοί."
" 
So he spoke, and Patroclus obeyed his dear comrade, [345] and led forth from the hut the fair-cheeked Briseis, and gave her to them to lead away.","ὣς φάτο, Πάτροκλος δὲ φίλῳ ἐπεπείθεθ̓ ἑταίρῳ, ἐκ δ̓ ἄγαγε κλισίης Βρισηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον, δῶκε δ̓ ἄγειν·"
"  So the two went back beside the ships of the Achaeans, and with them, all unwilling, went the woman.","τὼ δ̓ αὖτις ἴτην παρὰ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν·||ἣ δ̓ ἀέκουσ̓ ἅμα τοῖσι γυνὴ κίεν·"
" But Achilles burst into tears, and withdrew apart from his comrades, and sat down on the shore of the grey sea, looking forth over the wine-dark deep.","αὐτὰρ Ἀχιλλεὺς δακρύσας ἑτάρων ἄφαρ ἕζετο νόσφι λιασθείς, θῖν̓ ἔφ̓ ἁλὸς πολιῆς, ὁρόων ἐπ̓ ἀπείρονα πόντον·"
" [350] Earnestly he prayed to his dear mother with hands outstretched:","πολλὰ δὲ μητρὶ φίλῃ ἠρήσατο χεῖρας ὀρεγνύς·"
" ""Mother, since you bore me, though to so brief a span of life, honour surely ought the Olympian to have given into my hands, Zeus who thunders on high; but now he has honoured me not a bit.","μῆτερ ἐπεί μ̓ ἔτεκές γε μινυνθάδιόν περ ἐόντα, τιμήν πέρ μοι ὄφελλεν Ὀλύμπιος ἐγγυαλίξαι Ζεὺς ὑψιβρεμέτης·||νῦν δ̓ οὐ δέ με τυτθὸν ἔτισεν·"
" Truly the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon [355] has dishonoured me:","ἦ γάρ μ̓ Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων ἠτίμησεν·"
" for he has taken and keeps my prize through his own arrogant act.""","ἑλὼν γὰρ ἔχει γέρας αὐτὸς ἀπούρας."
"
So he spoke, weeping, and his lady mother heard him, as she sat in the depths of the sea beside the old man, her father.","ὣς φάτο δάκρυ χέων, τοῦ δ̓ ἔκλυε πότνια μήτηρ ἡμένη ἐν βένθεσσιν ἁλὸς παρὰ πατρὶ γέροντι·"
"  And speedily she came forth from the grey sea like a mist, and sat down before him, as he wept, [360] and she stroked him with her hand, and spoke to him, and called him by name:","καρπαλίμως δ̓ ἀνέδυ πολιῆς ἁλὸς ἠΰτ̓ ὀμίχλη, καί ῥα πάροιθ̓ αὐτοῖο καθέζετο δάκρυ χέοντος, χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξεν ἔπος τ̓ ἔφατ̓ ἔκ τ̓ ὀνόμαζε·"
" ""My child, why do you weep?","τέκνον τί κλαίεις;"
" What sorrow has come upon your heart?","τί δέ σε φρένας ἵκετο πένθος;"
"  Speak out; hide it not in your mind, that we both may know.""","ἐξαύδα, μὴ κεῦθε νόῳ, ἵνα εἴδομεν ἄμφω."
"
Then with heavy moaning spoke swift-footed Achilles to her:","τὴν δὲ βαρὺ στενάχων προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·"
" ""You know.",οἶσθα·
"  Why then should I tell the tale to you who knows all?","τί ἤ τοι ταῦτα ἰδυίῃ πάντ̓ ἀγορεύω;"
" [365] We went forth to Thebe, the sacred city of Eetion, and laid it waste, and brought here all the spoil.","ᾠχόμεθ̓ ἐς Θήβην ἱερὴν πόλιν Ἠετίωνος, τὴν δὲ διεπράθομέν τε καὶ ἤγομεν ἐνθάδε πάντα·"
" This the sons of the Achaeans divided properly among themselves, but for the son of Atreus they chose out the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses.","καὶ τὰ μὲν εὖ δάσσαντο μετὰ σφίσιν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν, ἐκ δ̓ ἕλον Ἀτρεΐδῃ Χρυσηΐδα καλλιπάρῃον."
"  However, Chryses, priest of Apollo, who strikes from afar, [370] came to the swift ships of the bronze-clad Achaeans, to free his daughter, bearing ransom past counting, and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar, on a staff of gold, and he implored all the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, marshallers of the people.","Χρύσης δ̓ αὖθ̓ ἱερεὺς ἑκατηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος ἦλθε θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων λυσόμενός τε θύγατρα φέρων τ̓ ἀπερείσἰ ἄποινα, στέμματ̓ ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος χρυσέῳ ἀνὰ σκήπτρῳ, καὶ λίσσετο πάντας Ἀχαιούς, Ἀτρεΐδα δὲ μάλιστα δύω κοσμήτορε λαῶν."
" [375] Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom; yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command.","ἔνθ̓ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες ἐπευφήμησαν Ἀχαιοὶ αἰδεῖσθαί θ̓ ἱερῆα καὶ ἀγλαὰ δέχθαι ἄποινα·||ἀλλ̓ οὐκ Ἀτρεΐδῃ Ἀγαμέμνονι ἥνδανε θυμῷ, ἀλλὰ κακῶς ἀφίει, κρατερὸν δ̓ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε·"
" So the old man went back again in anger; and Apollo [380] heard his prayer, for he was very dear to him, and sent against the Argives an evil shaft.","χωόμενος δ̓ ὁ γέρων πάλιν ᾤχετο·||τοῖο δ̓ Ἀπόλλων εὐξαμένου ἤκουσεν, ἐπεὶ μάλα οἱ φίλος ἦεν, ἧκε δ̓ ἐπ̓ Ἀργείοισι κακὸν βέλος·"
" Then the people began to die thick and fast, and the shafts of the god ranged everywhere throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans.","οἳ δέ νυ λαοὶ θνῇσκον ἐπασσύτεροι, τὰ δ̓ ἐπῴχετο κῆλα θεοῖο πάντῃ ἀνὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν·"
"  But to us the prophet with sure knowledge declared the oracles of the god who strikes from afar.","ἄμμι δὲ μάντις εὖ εἰδὼς ἀγόρευε θεοπροπίας ἑκάτοιο."
" Forthwith, then, I first bade propitiate the god, but thereafter anger seized the son of Atreus, and straightway he arose and spoke a threatening word, which now has come to pass.","αὐτίκ̓ ἐγὼ πρῶτος κελόμην θεὸν ἱλάσκεσθαι·||Ἀτρεΐωνα δ̓ ἔπειτα χόλος λάβεν, αἶψα δ̓ ἀναστὰς ἠπείλησεν μῦθον ὃ δὴ τετελεσμένος ἐστί·"
"  For the quick-glancing Achaeans are taking the maiden in a swift ship to Chryse, and are bearing gifts to the god; [390] while the other woman the heralds have just now taken from my tent and led away, the daughter of Briseus, whom the sons of the Achaeans gave me.","τὴν μὲν γὰρ σὺν νηῒ θοῇ ἑλίκωπες Ἀχαιοὶ ἐς Χρύσην πέμπουσιν, ἄγουσι δὲ δῶρα ἄνακτι·||τὴν δὲ νέον κλισίηθεν ἔβαν κήρυκες ἄγοντες κούρην Βρισῆος τήν μοι δόσαν υἷες Ἀχαιῶν.||ἀλλὰ σὺ εἰ δύνασαί γε περίσχεο παιδὸς ἑῆος·"
"  But, you, if you are able, guard your own son; go to Olympus and make prayer to Zeus, if ever you have gladdened his heart by word or deed.","ἐλθοῦσ̓ Οὔλυμπον δὲ Δία λίσαι, εἴ ποτε δή τι ἢ ἔπει ὤνησας κραδίην Διὸς ἠὲ καὶ ἔργῳ."
" [395] For often I have heard you glorying in the halls of my father, and declaring that you alone among the immortals warded off shameful ruin from the son of Cronos, lord of the dark clouds, on the day when the other Olympians wished to put him in bonds, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene.","πολλάκι γάρ σεο πατρὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄκουσα εὐχομένης ὅτ̓ ἔφησθα κελαινεφέϊ Κρονίωνι οἴη ἐν ἀθανάτοισιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀμῦναι, ὁππότε μιν ξυνδῆσαι Ὀλύμπιοι ἤθελον ἄλλοι Ἥρη τ̓ ἠδὲ Ποσειδάων καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη·"
" [400] But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds, when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father.","ἀλλὰ σὺ τόν γ̓ ἐλθοῦσα θεὰ ὑπελύσαο δεσμῶν, ὦχ̓ ἑκατόγχειρον καλέσασ̓ ἐς μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον, ὃν Βριάρεων καλέουσι θεοί, ἄνδρες δέ τε πάντες Αἰγαίων̓, ὃ γὰρ αὖτε βίην οὗ πατρὸς ἀμείνων·"
" He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, [405] and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus.","ὅς ῥα παρὰ Κρονίωνι καθέζετο κύδεϊ γαίων·||τὸν καὶ ὑπέδεισαν μάκαρες θεοὶ οὐ δ̓ ἔτ̓ ἔδησαν."
" Bring this now to his remembrance, and sit by his side, and clasp his knees, in hope that he might perhaps wish to succour the Trojans, and for those others, the Achaeans, to pen them in among the sterns of their ships and around the sea as they are slain, so that they may all have profit of their king, [410] and that the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon may know his blindness in that he did no honour to the best of the Achaeans.""","τῶν νῦν μιν μνήσασα παρέζεο καὶ λαβὲ γούνων αἴ κέν πως ἐθέλῃσιν ἐπὶ Τρώεσσιν ἀρῆξαι, τοὺς δὲ κατὰ πρύμνας τε καὶ ἀμφ̓ ἅλα ἔλσαι Ἀχαιοὺς κτεινομένους, ἵνα πάντες ἐπαύρωνται βασιλῆος, γνῷ δὲ καὶ Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων ἣν ἄτην ὅ τ̓ ἄριστον Ἀχαιῶν οὐδὲν ἔτισεν.||τὸν δ̓ ἠμείβετ̓ ἔπειτα Θέτις κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσα·"
"
Then Thetis answered him as she wept:","ὤ μοι τέκνον ἐμόν, τί νύ σ̓ ἔτρεφον αἰνὰ τεκοῦσα;"
" ""Ah me, my child, why did I rear you, cursed in my child-bearing?","αἴθ̓ ὄφελες παρὰ νηυσὶν ἀδάκρυτος καὶ ἀπήμων ἧσθαι, ἐπεί νύ τοι αἶσα μίνυνθά περ οὔ τι μάλα δήν·"
"  Would that it had been your lot to remain by your ships without tears and without grief, [415] since your span of life is brief and endures no long time; but now you are doomed to a speedy death and are laden with sorrow above all men; therefore to an evil fate I bore you in our halls.","νῦν δ̓ ἅμα τ̓ ὠκύμορος καὶ ὀϊζυρὸς περὶ πάντων ἔπλεο·||τώ σε κακῇ αἴσῃ τέκον ἐν μεγάροισι.||τοῦτο δέ τοι ἐρέουσα ἔπος Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ εἶμ̓ αὐτὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον ἀγάννιφον αἴ κε πίθηται."
"  Yet in order to tell this your word to Zeus who delights in the thunderbolt I will myself go to snowy Olympus, in hope that he may be persuaded.",
" [420] But remain by your swift, sea-faring ships, and continue your wrath against the Achaeans, and refrain utterly from battle; for Zeus went yesterday to Oceanus, to the blameless Ethiopians for a feast, and all the gods followed with him; but on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus, [425] and then will I go to the house of Zeus with threshold of bronze, and will clasp his knees in prayer, and I think I shall win him.""","ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν νηυσὶ παρήμενος ὠκυπόροισι μήνἰ Ἀχαιοῖσιν, πολέμου δ̓ ἀποπαύεο πάμπαν·"
,"Ζεὺς γὰρ ἐς Ὠκεανὸν μετ̓ ἀμύμονας Αἰθιοπῆας χθιζὸς ἔβη κατὰ δαῖτα, θεοὶ δ̓ ἅμα πάντες ἕποντο·||δωδεκάτῃ δέ τοι αὖτις ἐλεύσεται Οὔλυμπον δέ, καὶ τότ̓ ἔπειτά τοι εἶμι Διὸς ποτὶ χαλκοβατὲς δῶ, καί μιν γουνάσομαι καί μιν πείσεσθαι ὀΐω."
" 
So saying, she went her way and left him where he was, angry at heart for the fair-girdled woman's sake, whom they had taken from him by force though he was unwilling; and meanwhile Odysseus [430] came to Chryse bringing the holy hecatomb.","ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασ̓ ἀπεβήσετο, τὸν δὲ λίπ̓ αὐτοῦ χωόμενον κατὰ θυμὸν ἐϋζώνοιο γυναικὸς τήν ῥα βίῃ ἀέκοντος ἀπηύρων·||αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐς Χρύσην ἵκανεν ἄγων ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην."
"  When they had arrived within the deep harbour, they furled the sail, and stowed it in the black ship, and the mast they lowered by the forestays and brought it to the crutch with speed, and rowed her with oars to the place of anchorage.","οἳ δ̓ ὅτε δὴ λιμένος πολυβενθέος ἐντὸς ἵκοντο ἱστία μὲν στείλαντο, θέσαν δ̓ ἐν νηῒ μελαίνῃ, ἱστὸν δ̓ ἱστοδόκῃ πέλασαν προτόνοισιν ὑφέντες καρπαλίμως, τὴν δ̓ εἰς ὅρμον προέρεσσαν ἐρετμοῖς."
" [435] Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea.","ἐκ δ̓ εὐνὰς ἔβαλον, κατὰ δὲ πρυμνήσἰ ἔδησαν·"
"  They brought forth the hecatomb for Apollo, who strikes from afar, and forth stepped also the daughter of Chryses from the sea-faring ship.","ἐκ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ βαῖνον ἐπὶ ῥηγμῖνι θαλάσσης, ἐκ δ̓ ἑκατόμβην βῆσαν ἑκηβόλῳ Ἀπόλλωνι·||ἐκ δὲ Χρυσηῒς νηὸς βῆ ποντοπόροιο."
"  Her then did Odysseus of many wiles lead to the altar, [440] and place in the arms of her dear father, saying to him:","τὴν μὲν ἔπειτ̓ ἐπὶ βωμὸν ἄγων πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεὺς πατρὶ φίλῳ ἐν χερσὶ τίθει καί μιν προσέειπεν·"
" ""Chryses, Agamemnon, king of men, sent me forth to bring to you your daughter, and to offer to Phoebus a holy hecatomb on the Danaans' behalf, that therewith we may propitiate the lord, who has now brought upon the Argives woeful lamentation.""","ὦ Χρύση, πρό μ̓ ἔπεμψεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων παῖδά τε σοὶ ἀγέμεν, Φοίβῳ θ̓ ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ῥέξαι ὑπὲρ Δαναῶν ὄφῤ ἱλασόμεσθα ἄνακτα, ὃς νῦν Ἀργείοισι πολύστονα κήδἐ ἐφῆκεν."
" [445] 
So saying he placed her in his arms, and he joyfully took his dear child; but they made haste to set in array for the god the holy hecatomb around the well-built altar, and then they washed their hands and took up the barley grains.","ὣς εἰπὼν ἐν χερσὶ τίθει, ὃ δὲ δέξατο χαίρων παῖδα φίλην·||τοὶ δ̓ ὦκα θεῷ ἱερὴν ἑκατόμβην ἑξείης ἔστησαν ἐΰδμητον περὶ βωμόν, χερνίψαντο δ̓ ἔπειτα καὶ οὐλοχύτας ἀνέλοντο."
"  Then Chryses lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud for them:","τοῖσιν δὲ Χρύσης μεγάλ̓ εὔχετο χεῖρας ἀνασχών·"
" [450] ""Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stands over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rules mightily over Tenedos.","κλῦθί μευ ἀργυρότοξ̓, ὃς Χρύσην ἀμφιβέβηκας Κίλλαν τε ζαθέην Τενέδοιό τε ἶφι ἀνάσσεις·"
"  As before you heard me when I prayed—to me you did honour, and mightily smote the host of the Achaeans—even so now fulfill me this my desire:","ἦ μὲν δή ποτ̓ ἐμεῦ πάρος ἔκλυες εὐξαμένοιο, τίμησας μὲν ἐμέ, μέγα δ̓ ἴψαο λαὸν Ἀχαιῶν·||ἠδ̓ ἔτι καὶ νῦν μοι τόδ̓ ἐπικρήηνον ἐέλδωρ·"
" [455] ward off now from the Danaans the loathly pestilence.""","ἤδη νῦν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἄμυνον."
,"ὣς ἔφατ̓ εὐχόμενος, τοῦ δ̓ ἔκλυε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων."
" 
So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him.","αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ̓ εὔξαντο καὶ οὐλοχύτας προβάλοντο, αὐέρυσαν μὲν πρῶτα καὶ ἔσφαξαν καὶ ἔδειραν, μηρούς τ̓ ἐξέταμον κατά τε κνίσῃ ἐκάλυψαν δίπτυχα ποιήσαντες, ἐπ̓ αὐτῶν δ̓ ὠμοθέτησαν·"
"  Then, when they had prayed, and had sprinkled the barley grains, they first drew back the victims' heads, and cut their throats, and flayed them, and cut out the thighs and covered them [460] with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh thereon.","καῖε δ̓ ἐπὶ σχίζῃς ὁ γέρων, ἐπὶ δ̓ αἴθοπα οἶνον λεῖβε·||νέοι δὲ παῤ αὐτὸν ἔχον πεμπώβολα χερσίν.||αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μῆρε κάη καὶ σπλάγχνα πάσαντο, μίστυλλόν τ̓ ἄρα τἆλλα καὶ ἀμφ̓ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειραν, ὤπτησάν τε περιφραδέως, ἐρύσαντό τε πάντα."
" And the old man burned them on stakes of wood, and made libation over them of gleaming wine; and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks.",
"  But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the entrails, they cut up the rest and spitted it, [465] and roasted it carefully, and drew all off the spits.","αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ παύσαντο πόνου τετύκοντό τε δαῖτα δαίνυντ̓, οὐ δέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐΐσης."
"  Then, when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they feasted, nor did their hearts lack anything of the equal feast.","αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο, κοῦροι μὲν κρητῆρας ἐπεστέψαντο ποτοῖο, νώμησαν δ̓ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπαρξάμενοι δεπάεσσιν·"
"  But when they had put from them the desire for food and drink, the youths filled the bowls brim full of drink [470] and served out to all, first pouring drops for libation into the cups.","οἳ δὲ πανημέριοι μολπῇ θεὸν ἱλάσκοντο καλὸν ἀείδοντες παιήονα κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν μέλποντες ἑκάεργον·||ὃ δὲ φρένα τέρπετ̓ ἀκούων."
"  So the whole day long they sought to appease the god with song, singing the beautiful paean, the sons of the Achaeans, hymning the god who works from afar; and his heart was glad, as he heard.","ἦμος δ̓ ἠέλιος κατέδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθε, δὴ τότε κοιμήσαντο παρὰ πρυμνήσια νηός·"
"
But when the sun set and darkness came on, [475] they lay down to rest by the stern cables of the ship, and as soon as early rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, then they set sail for the wide camp of the Achaeans.","ἦμος δ̓ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς, καὶ τότ̓ ἔπειτ̓ ἀνάγοντο μετὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν·||τοῖσιν δ̓ ἴκμενον οὖρον ἵει ἑκάεργος Ἀπόλλων·"
"  And Apollo, who works from afar, sent them a favouring wind, and they set up the mast and spread the white sail.","οἳ δ̓ ἱστὸν στήσαντ̓ ἀνά θ̓ ἱστία λευκὰ πέτασσαν, ἐν δ̓ ἄνεμος πρῆσεν μέσον ἱστίον, ἀμφὶ δὲ κῦμα στείρῃ πορφύρεον μεγάλ̓ ἴαχε νηὸς ἰούσης·"
" [480] So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship, as she went, and she sped over the wave, accomplishing her way.","ἣ δ̓ ἔθεεν κατὰ κῦμα διαπρήσσουσα κέλευθον."
"  But when they came to the wide camp of the Achaeans, they drew the black ship up on the shore, [485] high upon the sands, and set in line the long props beneath, and themselves scattered among the tents and ships.","αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ̓ ἵκοντο κατὰ στρατὸν εὐρὺν Ἀχαιῶν, νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἐπ̓ ἠπείροιο ἔρυσσαν ὑψοῦ ἐπὶ ψαμάθοις, ὑπὸ δ̓ ἕρματα μακρὰ τάνυσσαν·"
"
But he in his wrath sat beside his swift-faring ships, the Zeus-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles.","αὐτοὶ δ̓ ἐσκίδναντο κατὰ κλισίας τε νέας τε."
" Never did he go forth to the place of gathering, where men win glory, [490] nor ever to war, but wasted away his own heart, as he tarried where he was; and he longed for the war-cry and the battle.","αὐτὰρ ὃ μήνιε νηυσὶ παρήμενος ὠκυπόροισι διογενὴς Πηλῆος υἱὸς πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς·"
,"οὔτέ ποτ̓ εἰς ἀγορὴν πωλέσκετο κυδιάνειραν οὔτέ ποτ̓ ἐς πόλεμον, ἀλλὰ φθινύθεσκε φίλον κῆρ αὖθι μένων, ποθέεσκε δ̓ ἀϋτήν τε πτόλεμόν τε."
" 
Now when the twelfth morning thereafter had come, then into Olympus came the gods who are for ever, all in one company, and Zeus led the way.","ἀλλ̓ ὅτε δή ῥ̓ ἐκ τοῖο δυωδεκάτη γένετ̓ ἠώς, καὶ τότε δὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον ἴσαν θεοὶ αἰὲν ἐόντες πάντες ἅμα, Ζεὺς δ̓ ἦρχε·"
"  And Thetis did not forget the behest [495] of her son, but rose up from the wave of the sea, and at early morning went up to great heaven and Olympus.","Θέτις δ̓ οὐ λήθετ̓ ἐφετμέων παιδὸς ἑοῦ, ἀλλ̓ ἥ γ̓ ἀνεδύσετο κῦμα θαλάσσης.||ἠερίη δ̓ ἀνέβη μέγαν οὐρανὸν Οὔλυμπόν τε."
"  There she found the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the rest upon the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus.","εὗρεν δ̓ εὐρύοπα Κρονίδην ἄτερ ἥμενον ἄλλων ἀκροτάτῃ κορυφῇ πολυδειράδος Οὐλύμποιο·"
"  So she sat down before him, and clasped his knees [500] with her left hand, while with her right she touched him beneath the chin, and she spoke in prayer to king Zeus, son of Cronos:","καί ῥα πάροιθ̓ αὐτοῖο καθέζετο, καὶ λάβε γούνων σκαιῇ, δεξιτερῇ δ̓ ἄῤ ὑπ̓ ἀνθερεῶνος ἑλοῦσα λισσομένη προσέειπε Δία Κρονίωνα ἄνακτα·"
" ""Father Zeus, if ever amid the immortals I gave you aid by word or deed, grant me this prayer:","Ζεῦ πάτερ εἴ ποτε δή σε μετ̓ ἀθανάτοισιν ὄνησα ἢ ἔπει ἢ ἔργῳ, τόδε μοι κρήηνον ἐέλδωρ·"
" do honour to my son, who is doomed to a speedy death beyond all other men; [505] yet now Agamemnon, king of men, has dishonoured him, for he has taken and keeps his prize by his own arrogant act.","τίμησόν μοι υἱὸν ὃς ὠκυμορώτατος ἄλλων ἔπλετ̓·"
"  But honour him, Olympian Zeus, lord of counsel; and give might to the Trojans, until the Achaeans do honour to my son, and magnify him with recompense.""","ἀτάρ μιν νῦν γε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων ἠτίμησεν·||ἑλὼν γὰρ ἔχει γέρας αὐτὸς ἀπούρας.||ἀλλὰ σύ πέρ μιν τῖσον Ὀλύμπιε μητίετα Ζεῦ·"
" [510] 
So she spoke; but Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, spoke no word to her, but sat a long time in silence.","τόφρα δ̓ ἐπὶ Τρώεσσι τίθει κράτος ὄφῤ ἂν Ἀχαιοὶ υἱὸν ἐμὸν τίσωσιν ὀφέλλωσίν τέ ἑ τιμῇ."
" Yet Thetis, even as she had clasped his knees, so held to him, clinging close, and questioned him again a second time:","ὣς φάτο·||τὴν δ̓ οὔ τι προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς, ἀλλ̓ ἀκέων δὴν ἧστο·"
" ""Give me your infallible promise, and bow your head to it, or else deny me, for there is nothing to make you afraid; so that I may know well [515] how far I among all the gods am honoured the least.""","Θέτις δ̓ ὡς ἥψατο γούνων ὣς ἔχετ̓ ἐμπεφυυῖα, καὶ εἴρετο δεύτερον αὖτις·||νημερτὲς μὲν δή μοι ὑπόσχεο καὶ κατάνευσον ἢ ἀπόειπ̓, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἔπι δέος, ὄφῤ ἐῢ εἰδέω ὅσσον ἐγὼ μετὰ πᾶσιν ἀτιμοτάτη θεός εἰμι.||τὴν δὲ μέγ̓ ὀχθήσας προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς·||ἦ δὴ λοίγια ἔργ̓ ὅ τέ μ̓ ἐχθοδοπῆσαι ἐφήσεις Ἥρῃ ὅτ̓ ἄν μ̓ ἐρέθῃσιν ὀνειδείοις ἐπέεσσιν·||ἣ δὲ καὶ αὔτως μ̓ αἰεὶ ἐν ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι νεικεῖ, καί τέ μέ φησι μάχῃ Τρώεσσιν ἀρήγειν."
"
Then, greatly troubled, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer spoke to her:",
" ""Surely this will be sorry work, since you will set me on to engage in strife with Hera, when she shall anger me with taunting words.",
"  Even now she always upbraids me among the immortal gods, [520] and declares that I give aid to the Trojans in battle.","ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν αὖτις ἀπόστιχε μή τι νοήσῃ Ἥρη·||ἐμοὶ δέ κε ταῦτα μελήσεται ὄφρα τελέσσω·"
"  But for the present, depart again, lest Hera note something; and I will take thought for these things to bring all to pass.","εἰ δ̓ ἄγε τοι κεφαλῇ κατανεύσομαι ὄφρα πεποίθῃς·||τοῦτο γὰρ ἐξ ἐμέθεν γε μετ̓ ἀθανάτοισι μέγιστον τέκμωρ·"
"  Come, I will bow my head to you, that thou may be certain, for this from me is the surest token among the immortals; [525] no word of mine may be recalled, nor is false, nor unfulfilled, to which I bow my head.""","οὐ γὰρ ἐμὸν παλινάγρετον οὐ δ̓ ἀπατηλὸν οὐ δ̓ ἀτελεύτητον ὅ τί κεν κεφαλῇ κατανεύσω.||ἦ καὶ κυανέῃσιν ἐπ̓ ὀφρύσι νεῦσε Κρονίων·"
"
The son of Cronos spoke, and bowed his dark brow in assent, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake.","ἀμβρόσιαι δ̓ ἄρα χαῖται ἐπερρώσαντο ἄνακτος κρατὸς ἀπ̓ ἀθανάτοιο·||μέγαν δ̓ ἐλέλιξεν Ὄλυμπον."
" 
When the two had taken counsel together in this way, they parted; she leapt straightway into the deep sea from gleaming Olympus, and Zeus went to his own palace.","τώ γ̓ ὣς βουλεύσαντε διέτμαγεν·||ἣ μὲν ἔπειτα εἰς ἅλα ἆλτο βαθεῖαν ἀπ̓ αἰγλήεντος Ὀλύμπου, Ζεὺς δὲ ἑὸν πρὸς δῶμα·"
"  All the gods together rose from their seats before the face of their father; no one dared to await his coming, but they all rose up before him.","θεοὶ δ̓ ἅμα πάντες ἀνέσταν ἐξ ἑδέων σφοῦ πατρὸς ἐναντίον·||οὐ δέ τις ἔτλη μεῖναι ἐπερχόμενον, ἀλλ̓ ἀντίοι ἔσταν ἅπαντες."
" [535] So he sat down there upon his throne; but Hera saw, and failed not to note how silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, had taken counsel with him.","ὣς ὃ μὲν ἔνθα καθέζετ̓ ἐπὶ θρόνου·||οὐ δέ μιν Ἥρη ἠγνοίησεν ἰδοῦσ̓ ὅτι οἱ συμφράσσατο βουλὰς ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις θυγάτηρ ἁλίοιο γέροντος."
"  Forthwith then she spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, with mocking words:","αὐτίκα κερτομίοισι Δία Κρονίωνα προσηύδα·"
" ""Who of the gods, crafty one, has now again taken counsel with you?","τίς δ̓ αὖ τοι δολομῆτα θεῶν συμφράσσατο βουλάς;"
" [540] Always is it your pleasure to hold aloof from me, and to give judgments which you have pondered in secret, nor have you ever brought yourself with a ready heart to declare to me the matter which you devise.""","αἰεί τοι φίλον ἐστὶν ἐμεῦ ἀπὸ νόσφιν ἐόντα κρυπτάδια φρονέοντα δικαζέμεν·||οὐ δέ τί πώ μοι πρόφρων τέτληκας εἰπεῖν ἔπος ὅττι νοήσῃς."
"
In answer to her spoke the father of men and gods:","τὴν δ̓ ἠμείβετ̓ ἔπειτα πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε·"
" ""Hera, do not hope to know all my words:","Ἥρη μὴ δὴ πάντας ἐμοὺς ἐπιέλπεο μύθους εἰδήσειν·"
" [545] hard will they prove for you, though you are my wife.","χαλεποί τοι ἔσοντ̓ ἀλόχῳ περ ἐούσῃ·"
"  Whatever it is fitting for you to hear, this none other shall know before you, whether of gods or men; but what I wish to devise apart from the gods, of all this do not in any way inquire nor ask.""","ἀλλ̓ ὃν μέν κ̓ ἐπιεικὲς ἀκουέμεν οὔ τις ἔπειτα οὔ τε θεῶν πρότερος τὸν εἴσεται οὔ τ̓ ἀνθρώπων·||ὃν δέ κ̓ ἐγὼν ἀπάνευθε θεῶν ἐθέλωμι νοῆσαι μή τι σὺ ταῦτα ἕκαστα διείρεο μη δὲ μετάλλα."
" [550] 
In answer to him spoke the ox-eyed lady Hera:","τὸν δ̓ ἠμείβετ̓ ἔπειτα βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη·"
" ""Most dread son of Cronos, what a word you have said!","αἰνότατε Κρονίδη ποῖον τὸν μῦθον ἔειπες;"
"  Truly, in the past I have not been accustomed to inquire nor ask you, but at your ease you devise all things whatever you wish.","καὶ λίην σε πάρος γ̓ οὔ τ̓ εἴρομαι οὔ τε μεταλλῶ, ἀλλὰ μάλ̓ εὔκηλος τὰ φράζεαι ἅσσ̓ ἐθέλῃσθα."
" But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest [555] silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, have beguiled you; for at early dawn she sat by you and clasped your knees.","νῦν δ̓ αἰνῶς δείδοικα κατὰ φρένα μή σε παρείπῃ ἀργυρόπεζα Θέτις θυγάτηρ ἁλίοιο γέροντος·||ἠερίη γὰρ σοί γε παρέζετο καὶ λάβε γούνων·"
"  To her, I think, you bowed your head in sure token that you will honour Achilles, and bring many to death beside the ships of the Achaeans.""","τῇ σ̓ ὀΐω κατανεῦσαι ἐτήτυμον ὡς Ἀχιλῆα τιμήσῃς, ὀλέσῃς δὲ πολέας ἐπὶ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν."
"
Then in answer to her spoke Zeus, the cloud-gatherer:","τὴν δ̓ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς·"
" [560] ""Strange one, you are always suspecting, and I do not escape you; yet you shall be able to accomplish nothing, but shall be even further from my heart; and that shall be the worse for you.","δαιμονίη αἰεὶ μὲν ὀΐεαι οὐ δέ σε λήθω·||πρῆξαι δ̓ ἔμπης οὔ τι δυνήσεαι, ἀλλ̓ ἀπὸ θυμοῦ μᾶλλον ἐμοὶ ἔσεαι·||τὸ δέ τοι καὶ ῥίγιον ἔσται."
"  If this thing is as you say, then it must be pleasing to me.","εἰ δ̓ οὕτω τοῦτ̓ ἐστὶν ἐμοὶ μέλλει φίλον εἶναι·"
"  Sit down in silence, and obey my word, [565] lest all the gods that are in Olympus avail you not against my drawing near, when I put forth upon you my irresistible hands.""","ἀλλ̓ ἀκέουσα κάθησο, ἐμῷ δ̓ ἐπιπείθεο μύθῳ, μή νύ τοι οὐ χραίσμωσιν ὅσοι θεοί εἰσ̓ ἐν Ὀλύμπῳ ἆσσον ἰόνθ̓, ὅτε κέν τοι ἀάπτους χεῖρας ἐφείω."
" 
He spoke, and ox-eyed lady Hera was seized with fear, and sat down in silence, curbing her heart.","ὣς ἔφατ̓ ἔδεισεν δὲ βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη, καί ῥ̓ ἀκέουσα καθῆστο ἐπιγνάμψασα φίλον κῆρ·"
"  Then troubled were the gods of heaven throughout the palace of Zeus, [570] and among them Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, was first to speak, doing pleasure to his dear mother, white-armed Hera:","ὄχθησαν δ̓ ἀνὰ δῶμα Διὸς θεοὶ Οὐρανίωνες·||τοῖσιν δ̓ Ἥφαιστος κλυτοτέχνης ἦρχ̓ ἀγορεύειν μητρὶ φίλῃ ἐπίηρα φέρων λευκωλένῳ Ἥρῃ·"
" ""Surely this will be sorry work, that is no longer bearable, if you two are to wrangle thus for mortals' sakes, and set the gods in tumult; neither will there be any joy in the excellent feast, [575] since worse things prevail.","ἦ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ̓ ἔσσεται οὐ δ̓ ἔτ̓ ἀνεκτά, εἰ δὴ σφὼ ἕνεκα θνητῶν ἐριδαίνετον ὧδε, ἐν δὲ θεοῖσι κολῳὸν ἐλαύνετον·||οὐ δέ τι δαιτὸς ἐσθλῆς ἔσσεται ἦδος, ἐπεὶ τὰ χερείονα νικᾷ."
"  And I give counsel to my mother, wise though she be herself, to do pleasure to our dear father Zeus, that the father upbraid her not again, and bring confusion upon our feast.","μητρὶ δ̓ ἐγὼ παράφημι καὶ αὐτῇ περ νοεούσῃ πατρὶ φίλῳ ἐπίηρα φέρειν Διί, ὄφρα μὴ αὖτε νεικείῃσι πατήρ, σὺν δ̓ ἡμῖν δαῖτα ταράξῃ."
"  What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, were minded [580] to dash us from our seats!","εἴ περ γάρ κ̓ ἐθέλῃσιν Ὀλύμπιος ἀστεροπητὴς ἐξ ἑδέων στυφελίξαι·"
" for he is mightiest far.","ὃ γὰρ πολὺ φέρτατός ἐστιν."
"  But address him with gentle words; so shall the Olympian forthwith be gracious to us.""","ἀλλὰ σὺ τὸν ἐπέεσσι καθάπτεσθαι μαλακοῖσιν·"
"
So saying, he sprang up and placed in his dear mother's hand the double cup, and spoke to her:","αὐτίκ̓ ἔπειθ̓ ἵλαος Ὀλύμπιος ἔσσεται ἡμῖν."
" [585] ""Be patient, my mother, and endure for all your grief, lest, dear as you are to me, my eyes see you stricken, and then I shall in no way be able to succour you for all my sorrow; for a hard foe is the Olympian to meet in strife.","ὣς ἄῤ ἔφη καὶ ἀναΐξας δέπας ἀμφικύπελλον μητρὶ φίλῃ ἐν χειρὶ τίθει καί μιν προσέειπε·||τέτλαθι μῆτερ ἐμή, καὶ ἀνάσχεο κηδομένη περ, μή σε φίλην περ ἐοῦσαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖσιν ἴδωμαι θεινομένην, τότε δ̓ οὔ τι δυνήσομαι ἀχνύμενός περ χραισμεῖν·"
"  On a time before this, when I was striving to save you, [590] he caught me by the foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; the whole day long I was carried headlong, and at sunset I fell in Lemnos, and but little life was in me.","ἀργαλέος γὰρ Ὀλύμπιος ἀντιφέρεσθαι·||ἤδη γάρ με καὶ ἄλλοτ̓ ἀλεξέμεναι μεμαῶτα ῥῖψε ποδὸς τεταγὼν ἀπὸ βηλοῦ θεσπεσίοιο, πᾶν δ̓ ἦμαρ φερόμην, ἅμα δ̓ ἠελίῳ καταδύντι κάππεσον ἐν Λήμνῳ, ὀλίγος δ̓ ἔτι θυμὸς ἐνῆεν·"
"  There the Sintian folk quickly tended me for my fall.""","ἔνθά με Σίντιες ἄνδρες ἄφαρ κομίσαντο πεσόντα."
"
So he spoke, and the goddess, white-armed Hera, smiled, [595] and smiling took in her hand the cup from her son.","ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη, μειδήσασα δὲ παιδὸς ἐδέξατο χειρὶ κύπελλον·"
"  Then he poured wine for all the other gods from left to right, drawing forth sweet nectar from the bowl.","αὐτὰρ ὃ τοῖς ἄλλοισι θεοῖς ἐνδέξια πᾶσιν οἰνοχόει γλυκὺ νέκταρ ἀπὸ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων·"
"  And unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods, as they saw Hephaestus puffing through the palace.","ἄσβεστος δ̓ ἄῤ ἐνῶρτο γέλως μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν ὡς ἴδον Ἥφαιστον διὰ δώματα ποιπνύοντα."
" [600] 
Thus the whole day long till the setting of the sun they feasted, nor did their heart lack anything of the equal feast, nor of the beauteous lyre, that Apollo held, nor yet of the Muses, who sang, replying one to the other with sweet voices.","ὣς τότε μὲν πρόπαν ἦμαρ ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα δαίνυντ̓, οὐ δέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐΐσης, οὐ μὲν φόρμιγγος περικαλλέος ἣν ἔχ̓ Ἀπόλλων, Μουσάων θ̓ αἳ ἄειδον ἀμειβόμεναι ὀπὶ καλῇ."
"
But when the bright light of the sun was set, [605] they went each to his own house to take their rest, where for each one a palace had been built with cunning skill by the famed Hephaestus, the limping god; and Zeus, the Olympian, lord of the lightning, went to his couch, where of old he took his rest, whenever sweet sleep came upon him.","αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ κατέδυ λαμπρὸν φάος ἠελίοιο, οἳ μὲν κακκείοντες ἔβαν οἶκον δὲ ἕκαστος, ἧχι ἑκάστῳ δῶμα περικλυτὸς ἀμφιγυήεις Ἥφαιστος ποίησεν ἰδυίῃσι πραπίδεσσι·||Ζεὺς δὲ πρὸς ὃν λέχος ἤϊ̓ Ὀλύμπιος ἀστεροπητής, ἔνθα πάρος κοιμᾶθ̓ ὅτε μιν γλυκὺς ὕπνος ἱκάνοι·"
" [610] There went he up and slept, and beside him lay Hera of the golden throne.","ἔνθα καθεῦδ̓ ἀναβάς, παρὰ δὲ χρυσόθρονος Ἥρη."
