Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to Pylos or to goodly Elis, where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; '),(15059,'verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever.'),(15060,' For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not  take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. '),(15061,'To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead.'),(15062,' Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.\"'),(15063,'So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans.'),(15064,'Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel  from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, '),(15065,'and wonder seized every man.'),(15066,' Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them:'),(15067,'\n“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, '),(15068,'for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.'),(15069,'  Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor.'),(15070,' Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; '),(15071,'and they fell thick and fast.” '),(15072,' \n  So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. '),(15073,' Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, '),(15074,' for he alone saw before and after: '),(15075,'he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:'),(15076,'“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say.'),(15077,' Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, '),(15078,' for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly. They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife  of a prince,'),(15079,' who, they said, would never more return.

Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze.'),(15125,' This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through,  and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him.
