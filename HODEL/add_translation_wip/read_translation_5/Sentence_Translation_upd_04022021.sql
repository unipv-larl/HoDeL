Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze.'),(15125,' This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through,  and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him.
