'),(258,' \nThen, when they had prayed, and had sprinkled the barley grains, they first drew back the victims\' heads, and cut their throats, and flayed them, and cut out the thighs and covered them  with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh thereon.'),(259,' And the old man burned them on stakes of wood, and made libation over them of gleaming wine; '),(260,'  and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks.  '),(261,' But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the entrails, they cut up the rest and spitted it,  and roasted it carefully, and drew all off the spits.  '),(262,'  Then, when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they feasted, nor did their hearts lack anything of the equal feast.  '),(263,' But when they had put from them the desire for food and drink, the youths filled the bowls brim full of drink  and served out to all, first pouring drops for libation into the cups.'),(264,'So the whole day long they sought to appease the god with song, singing the beautiful paean, the sons of the Achaeans, hymning the god who works from afar; '),(265,'and his heart was glad, as he heard.'),(266,'But when the sun set and darkness came on,  they lay down to rest by the stern cables of the ship, '),(267,'and as soon as early rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, then they set sail for the wide camp of the Achaeans.'),(268,'  And Apollo, who works from afar, sent them a favouring wind, '),(269,'and they set up the mast and spread the white sail.\n So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship, '),(270,'as she went, and she sped over the wave, accomplishing her way.'),(271,'But when they came to the wide camp of the Achaeans, they drew the black ship up on the shore,  high upon the sands, and set in line the long props beneath, '),(272,'and themselves scattered among the tents and ships.'),(273,'\nBut he in his wrath sat beside his swift-faring ships, the Zeus-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles. '),(274,'\nNever did he go forth to the place of gathering, where men win glory,  nor ever to war, but wasted away his own heart, as he tarried where he was; and he longed for the war-cry and the battle. '),(275,' \nNow when the twelfth morning thereafter had come, then into Olympus came the gods who are for ever, all in one company, and Zeus led the way.  '),(276,' \nAnd Thetis did not forget the behest  of her son, but rose up from the wave of the sea, '),(277,' \nand at early morning went up to great heaven and Olympus.'),(278,' There she found the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the rest upon the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus.  '),(279,' So she sat down before him, and clasped his knees  with her left hand, while with her right she touched him beneath the chin, and she spoke in prayer to king Zeus, son of Cronos:'),(280,' \"Father Zeus, if ever amid the immortals I gave you aid by word or deed, grant me this prayer: '),(281,' do honour to my son, who is doomed to a speedy death beyond all other men;  '),(282,' yet now Agamemnon, king of men, has dishonoured him, '),(283,' for he has taken and keeps his prize by his own arrogant act.'),(284,'  But honour him, Olympian Zeus, lord of counsel; '),(285,'	and give might to the Trojans, until the Achaeans do honour to my son, and magnify him with recompense.\"'),(286,'  \nSo she spoke; but Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, spoke no word to her, but sat a long time in silence.'),(287,'  \nSo she spoke; but Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, spoke no word to her, but sat a long time in silence.'),(288,' Yet Thetis, even as she had clasped his knees, so held to him, clinging close, and questioned him again a second time: '),(289,'\"Give me your infallible promise, and bow your head to it, or else deny me, for there is nothing to make you afraid; so that I may know well  how far I among all the gods am honoured the least.\"'),(290,'\nThen, greatly troubled, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer spoke to her:'),(291,' \"Surely this will be sorry work, since you will set me on to engage in strife with Hera, when she shall anger me with taunting words.  '),(292,' Even now she always upbraids me among the immortal gods,  and declares that I give aid to the Trojans in battle.'),(293,'  But for the present, depart again, lest Hera note something; '),(294,'and I will take thought for these things to bring all to pass.'),(295,' Come, I will bow my head to you, that thou may be certain, '),(296,'for this from me is the surest token among the immortals;  	'),(297,'no word of mine may be recalled, nor is false, nor unfulfilled, to which I bow my head.\"'),(298,'\nThe son of Cronos spoke, and bowed his dark brow in assent, '),(299,'\nand the ambrosial locks waved from the king\'s immortal head; '),(300,'\nand he made great Olympus quake. '),(301,' \nWhen the two had taken counsel together in this way, they parted; '),(302,' \nshe leapt straightway into the deep sea from gleaming Olympus, and Zeus went to his own palace.'),(303,'All the gods together rose from their seats before the face of their father; '),(304,'no one dared to await his coming, but they all rose up before him.'),(305,' So he sat down there upon his throne; '),(306,'but Hera saw, and failed not to note how silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, had taken counsel with him.'),(307,'Forthwith then she spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, with mocking words:'),(308,' \"Who of the gods, crafty one, has now again taken counsel with you?'),(309,'  Always is it your pleasure to hold aloof from me, and to give judgments which you have pondered in secret, '),(310,' nor have you ever brought yourself with a ready heart to declare to me the matter which you devise.\"'),(311,'\nIn answer to her spoke the father of men and gods: '),(312,'\"Hera, do not hope to know all my words:'),(313,' hard will they prove for you, though you are my wife.'),(314,'Whatever it is fitting for you to hear, this none other shall know before you, whether of gods or men; '),(315,'  Whatever it is fitting for you to hear, this none other shall know before you, whether of gods or men; but what I wish to devise apart from the gods, of all this do not in any way inquire nor ask.\"'),(316,'  \nIn answer to him spoke the ox-eyed lady Hera: '),(317,'\"Most dread son of Cronos, what a word you have said!'),(318,'Truly, in the past I have not been accustomed to inquire nor ask you, but at your ease you devise all things whatever you wish.

Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to Pylos or to goodly Elis, where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; '),(15059,'verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever.'),(15060,' For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not  take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. '),(15061,'To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead.'),(15062,' Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.\"'),(15063,'So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans.'),(15064,'Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel  from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, '),(15065,'and wonder seized every man.'),(15066,' Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them:'),(15067,'\n“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, '),(15068,'for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.'),(15069,'  Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor.'),(15070,' Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; '),(15071,'and they fell thick and fast.” '),(15072,' \n  So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. '),(15073,' Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, '),(15074,' for he alone saw before and after: '),(15075,'he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:'),(15076,'“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say.'),(15077,' Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, '),(15078,' for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly.
